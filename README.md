# Forum Browser #

Forum Browser for Ubuntu using the [Tapatalk API](https://tapatalk.com/api.php)

#### Currently supported features: ####

* Adding and saving forums
* Supports all forums which have the [Tapatalk plugin](https://tapatalk.com/partners.php) installed
* Viewing forums
* Forum login
* Thread creation
* Replying to threads
* Viewing your subscriptions
* Subscribing to forums and threads

#### NOTE: Forum Browser is no longer being actively developed ####

With Tapatalk no longer updating their API documentation, shutting down their developer support forums and killing other third-party Tapatalk clients through their lawyers, I do not feel like continuing Forum Browser development is worth the effort.
